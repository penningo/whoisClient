whoisClient
===========

Very Basic whois Client Using Socket Server

The idea for this project is to show a simple method for using socet server to communicate with whois servers.

no repository requirements, simple make executable and execute with required commands. e.g.

./whoisClient.py -i origin AS3333 

This will execute command,

whois -h whois.ripe.net -i origin AS3333
